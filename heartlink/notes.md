Benefits of recruiting participants with friends and increasing social support for weight loss and maintenance. *Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 67*(1), 132–138. [https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.67.1.132](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.67.1.132)

**Short Summary**  
This study investigated how enrolling in a weight loss program with friends and receiving structured social support influenced both short-term success and long-term maintenance of weight loss. By comparing participants who joined alone versus those who joined with friends, the authors found that social support significantly improved adherence and outcomes over time.

**Why Relevant to Our Research**  
It highlights the power of partnership and shared accountability in achieving health goals—exactly what a two-person biking application could leverage by letting users see and react to each other’s heart rate data to remain motivated.

**Short Summary**  
This article provides a comprehensive overview of group cohesion in exercise settings, examining how shared goals, mutual support, and strong group identity can boost participation and adherence. It synthesizes existing literature on how teams or groups can foster motivation, enjoyment, and consistency in physical activity.

**Why Relevant to Our Research**  
Though it focuses on group exercise, the core principles of cohesion—cooperation, shared goals, and communication—are equally applicable to pairs. Understanding these factors can guide how we design features that enhance a sense of “togetherness” for two-person rides.

**Full Article Citation (with DOI)**  
Carron, A. V., Hausenblas, H. A., & Mack, D. (1996). Social influence and exercise: A meta-analysis. *Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology, 18*(1), 1–16. [https://doi.org/10.1123/jsep.18.1.1](https://doi.org/10.1123/jsep.18.1.1)

**Short Summary**  
In this meta-analysis, the authors investigated how various types of social influence—such as supportive friends, group norms, and family encouragement—affect individuals’ exercise behaviors. The results confirmed a significant positive link between social influence and higher levels of physical activity.

**Why Relevant to Our Research**  
It provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding *why* social or partner-based exercise is effective. This helps justify incorporating real-time heart rate sharing and interactive feedback between partners in your biking application.

**Short Summary**  
This commentary highlights that wearables by themselves—while they provide useful data—rarely lead to sustained behavior change. Instead, they become more powerful when integrated into broader strategies such as coaching, social support, and goal setting.

**Why Relevant to Our Research**  
It underscores the importance of combining real-time heart rate data with active social features (e.g., a biking partner’s feedback). Merely providing data is not enough; your app can enhance behavior change by encouraging collaborative goal-setting and mutual accountability.

Displaying heart rate data on a bicycle helmet to support social exertion experiences. *TEI ’14: Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction*, 97–104. [https://doi.org/10.1145/2540930.2540970](https://doi.org/10.1145/2540930.2540970)

**Short Summary**  
This paper introduces a prototype system enabling two people to jog “together” despite being in separate physical locations. By streaming audio cues and capturing movement data, the system promotes a shared experience that simulates running side by side. A user study demonstrates the potential for strengthening social ties, increasing motivation, and supporting remote collaboration in fitness.

**Overarching Contribution**  
- **Social Biofeedback**: Demonstrates how making physiological signals (like heart rate) visible can inform group members about each other’s exertion levels, enabling better coordination and empathy.  
- **Design Implications**: Provides insights into how tangible, wearable interfaces can be leveraged to cultivate richer social experiences in physically active settings.

**Why Relevant to Our Research**  
Your project aims to foster a shared biking experience between a novice and an experienced rider. This study’s insights into remotely sharing activity cues and progress can inform how you integrate real-time data (e.g., heart rate) and communication features, enabling partners to remain connected, aligned in pace, and collectively motivated.
